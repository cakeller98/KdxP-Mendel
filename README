KdxP Mendel - Killer dx(derivative) Prusa Mendel
This is mostly based on the ideas of the the Prusa Mendel, specifically mostly V2
However, not one single part will be used as-is
All parts will be remodelled, rethunk, and reworked to some degree.

It is currently a work in progress.

The main goal of this project is to:

  1) build on the genius that is/was... the Prusa Mendel!
  2) improve wherever possible
  3) use a REAL cad system to build a manufacturable model * <- this is just my preference.

I will NOT be building these in SCAD or any poly modeller.
I WILL be posting STEP and STL files.
Once the parts are tested and working - I would definitely welcome if someone wanted to convert the parts to SCAD for open sourceability... I just won't be working on that.

PLEASE NOTE!!! Until stated otherwise, this repository is PRE ALPHA!  do not expect a working printer from these parts.
However if you are excited by all things experimental, please print these up, test them out and post any problems you find in the issues section.

thanks!
